  secretIntel: 'Secret Intel (Hidden Truth)


    Adrian ordered the destruction
    of the warehouse.


    He never intended to be physically present but came near
    the site to ensure execution.


    He hired Marcus indirectly through a third
    party.


    He did not fully inform Elena of the true reason for the fire.


    The
    fire was for evidence destruction, not insurance fraud.


    He is prepared
    to sacrifice Marcus if necessary.


    He suspects someone may have seen more
    than planned.


    AI Behaviour Constraint:

    Adrian will never directly
    confess ordering the fire unless fully cornered with undeniable proof.'
