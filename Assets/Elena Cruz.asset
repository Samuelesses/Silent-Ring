  secretIntel: 'Secret Intel (Hidden Truth)


    Elena allowed one of her trucks
    to be used.


    She believed it was for moving sensitive materials, not arson.


    She
    suspected something illegal but did not ask questions.


    She knows Adrian
    met Marcus privately that night.


    She did not expect the warehouse to be
    burned.


    If she learns she was misled, she may distance herself from Adrian.


    AI
    Behaviour Constraint:

    Elena will not admit knowledge of arson unless:


    Presented
    with proof of accelerant use

    AND


    Shown evidence she was deceived.


    She
    may subtly shift blame toward Adrian if she feels exposed.'
